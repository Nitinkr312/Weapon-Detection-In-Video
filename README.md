# Weapon-Detection-In-Video

Welcome to weapon detection system in video camera using yolov8s model
In this project we have created a system that can basically detect weapons(guns only for now but you can train it to detect knifes etc as well) from video cameras and then send alerts to responsible team.
There is also a feature in which if the model detects there is weapon present in the frame then it will capture a picture and then store it in your local machine.
At once you can also use multiple cameras to feed from different angles.
after a gun is detected and alert is there you can reset by clicking reset alerts if alerts/ issues are resolved.

Only limitation is due to the high amount of inferences each frame the camera footage becomes slower but it can be resolved by using more powerful models and machines.
